# Multi Step Form - Level 2

This project involves building a ticket-ordering frontend app with a multi-step form. Please read the instructions carefully to ensure smooth progress. Good luck!

---

## Time Estimate

Between 1 to 1.5 hours, plus the time to set up the codebase.

---

## The Task

Your task is to build a ticket-ordering frontend app that:
1. Is build with Vanilla TypeScript or Angular + TypeScript ( Pickup the one you are the most confortable with )
2. Collects user input.
3. Uses correct input types for each field.
4. Validates the fields according to the validation rules provided below.
5. Preserves the state between steps.
6. Displays the collected information in the last step.
7. Passes the provided Cypress E2E tests.

Here’s the mockup with hints:

Feel free to tweak the UI, but ensure the following HTML structure is in place.

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository**: Start by cloning the project repository to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/jbsaouzanet/multi-step-form.git
   cd multi-step-form
   ```
2. Develop the solution in the cloned repository.
3. Once you are done, **host your project on your own GitHub repository**:
   - Create a new repository on your GitHub account.
   - Push your local codebase to your repository.

## Navigation Elements

Each screen of the application must contain navigation links, including links to every step of the form. Each step of the form should also include "Submit" and "Back" buttons.

Use `data-testid` attributes to identify these elements.

---

## The Form Steps

Each step of the form must have the following `data-testid` attributes:

### Step 1

```html
<form ...>
  <input data-testid="firstName" ... />
  <input data-testid="lastName" ... />
  <input data-testid="age" ... />
  <button data-testid="submit" />
</form>
```

### Step 2

```html
<form ...>
  <input data-testid="phone" ... />
  <input data-testid="email" ... />
  <button data-testid="submit" />
  <button data-testid="back" />
</form>
```

### Step 3

```html
<form ...>
  <input data-testid="seat" ... />
  <input data-testid="food" ... />
  <input data-testid="allergies" ... />
  <button data-testid="submit" />
  <button data-testid="back" />
</form>
```

### Result

On the results page, we expect to see the values collected by the form. Each element containing the value should have a `data-testid` field with the corresponding `field name`:

```html
<div data-testid="<field name>">value</div>
<button data-testid="back" />
```

> Here, we use `div` as an example element. In your application, it can be a `tr`, `span`, or any other element.
